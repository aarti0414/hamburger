    <h1>Beginners guide to JavaScript!!</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming
        language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting
        language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
        Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
        declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
